# Time Tracking

DoPlan automatically tracks time for every command, phase, and task. No manual logging needed - everything is tracked automatically!

---

## ⏱️ What is Time Tracking?

Time tracking in DoPlan is **completely automatic**. It tracks:
- Every command execution
- Each phase (ideation, planning, development)
- Complete task duration (from `/dev` to `/done`)
- Session duration
- Project time

**No manual action required!**

---

## 📊 What Gets Tracked

### Command Execution

Every command tracks:
- **Start time** - When command started
- **End time** - When command completed
- **Duration** - Total execution time
- **Status** - Completed or failed
- **Metadata** - Work style, experience level, etc.

### Task Duration

Complete task duration tracked:
- **Task start** - When `/dev` is run
- **Task end** - When `/done` is run
- **Total duration** - Full task time
- **Displayed** - Shown after completion

### Phase Tracking

Each phase tracked:
- **Ideation** - Time spent capturing idea
- **Planning** - Time spent generating plan
- **Development** - Time spent coding
- **Completion** - Time spent completing tasks

## 📁 Time Data Storage

### Location

Time data is stored in:
```
.do/system/time-tracker.jsonl
```

### Format (JSONL)

One entry per line in JSON format:

```json
{
  "project": "/path/to/project",
  "command": "/dev",
  "phase": "development",
  "args": ["auth"],
  "metadata": {
    "work_style": "fast",
    "experience_level": "intermediate"
  },
  "started_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2025-01-15T10:15:30Z",
  "duration_ms": 930000,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### Why JSONL?

- **Append-only** - Easy to add new entries
- **Analytics-ready** - Perfect for dashboards
- **Human-readable** - Can view with text editor
- **Efficient** - No need to parse entire file

## 🎯 Time Tracking Examples

### Command Execution

**Example**: Running `/plan`

```json
{
  "project": "/Users/you/my-project",
  "command": "/plan",
  "phase": "planning",
  "started_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2025-01-15T10:01:30Z",
  "duration_ms": 90000,
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Duration**: 1 minute 30 seconds

### Task Duration

**Example**: Task from `/dev` to `/done`

1. **Task Start** (`/dev`):
   - `task_started_at` stored in active_state.json
   - Time: 10:00 AM

2. **Development**:
   - You code for 2 hours

3. **Task End** (`/done`):
   - Duration calculated: 2 hours 15 minutes
   - Displayed: "⏱️ Task duration: 2h 15m"

**Total**: 2 hours 15 minutes tracked automatically
